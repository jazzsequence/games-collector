## Changelog ##

### 1.3.4 ###
* use the jQuery implementation of Isotope

### 1.3.3 ###
* require isotope as a dependency for our isotope loader

### 1.3.2 ###
* Update version for new Composer build

### 1.3.1 ###
* Uses composer for dependencies and updates paths

### 1.3.0 ###
* Added first Gutenberg block! Now you can add your games list in Gutenberg rather than using a shortcode. More Gutenberg blocks to come.

### 1.2.0 ###
* Added integration with Board Game Geek API. Games can now be added by searching BGG for matching titles and information imported and automatically added to new games.
* Fixed an issue where games with an indeterminate max number of players was displaying a 0 value (e.g. `2 - 0 players`) and combined that with games with an unrealistically large number of players (e.g. `2 - 99 players`) to display `{{min_players}}+ players` e.g. `2+ players`.
* Refactored the `gc_number_players` filter to only filter the actual number of players and added a `gc_number_players_output` filter which can filter the entire output (what `gc_number_players` previously did).
* Fixed an issue where only the highest difficulty was displaying in the dropdown.
* Fixed a display issue where games that can only be played with a specific number of players were still displaying the min/max player numbers. Changed to just display the number of players, e.g. `2 players` instead of `2 - 2 players`.
* Dropped support for `hhvm` and php 5.x. Require minimum of PHP 7.0.
* Scrutinizer CI integration for code coverage and quality checking.
* Cleaned up some code as a result of Scrutinizer sniffs.

### 1.1.0 ###
* Add activation hook that will create a Games page with the shortcode on plugin activation.
* Fixed some display errors and undefined notices on titles.
* Added more filters for display output. Now buttons can be filtered individually and therefore disabled.
* Switched to SVG images for game info icons which required some CSS changes.
* Cleaned up spacing for game attributes.
* Added [Shortcode UI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/) integration.
* Added shortcode that allows you to display a single or multiple specific games using `[games-collector-list gc_game="1,2,3"]`.

### 1.0.0 ###
* abstracted display elements into smaller functions and made them filterable
* added capability of SVGs to be output in base64-encoded or raw svg XML markup

### 0.2 ###
