# Extended Taxonomies #

Extended Taxonomies is a library which provides extended functionality to WordPress custom taxonomies, allowing developers to quickly build custom taxonomies without having to write the same code again and again.

This library requires its sister library [Extended CPTs](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-cpts) to be installed too.

## Improved defaults ##

 * Automatically generated labels and term updated messages
 * Public taxonomy with admin UI enabled

## Extended admin features ##

 * Ridiculously easy custom columns on the term listing screen:
   * Columns available for term meta and callback functions
   * User capability restrictions
 * Several custom meta boxes to choose from for the taxonomy's term input on the post editing screen:
   * 'simple' for a meta box with a simplified list of checkboxes
   * 'radio' for a meta box with radio inputs
   * 'dropdown' for a meta box with a dropdown menu
   * Or a callback function
 * Add the taxonomy to the 'At a Glance' section on the dashboard

## Extended front-end features ##

 * Automatic integration with the [Rewrite Rule Testing](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rewrite-testing/) plugin

## Minimum Requirements ##

**PHP:** 5.4  
**WordPress:** 4.4  
**[Extended CPTs](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-cpts):** 3.0

## Usage ##

Extended Taxonomies is a developer library, not a plugin, which means you need to include it somewhere in your own plugin or theme:

```php
require_once 'extended-taxos/extended-taxos.php';
```

Need a simple taxonomy with no frills? You can register a taxonomy with two parameters:

```php
register_extended_taxonomy( 'location', 'post' );
```

Try it. You'll have a hierarchical public taxonomy with an admin UI, and all the labels and term updated messages will be automatically generated. Or for a bit more functionality:

```php
register_extended_taxonomy( 'story', 'post', array(

	# Use radio buttons in the meta box for this taxonomy on the post editing screen:
	'meta_box' => 'radio',

	# Show this taxonomy in the 'At a Glance' dashboard widget:
	'dashboard_glance' => true,

	# Add a custom column to the admin screen:
	'admin_cols' => array(
		'updated' => array(
			'title'       => 'Updated',
			'meta_key'    => 'updated_date',
			'date_format' => 'd/m/Y'
		),
	),

), array(

	# Override the base names used for labels:
	'singular' => 'Story',
	'plural'   => 'Stories',
	'slug'     => 'tales'

) );
```

Bam, we have a 'Stories' taxonomy attached to the Post post type, with correctly generated labels and term updated messages, radio buttons in place of the standard meta box for this taxonomy on the post editing screen, a custom column in the admin area (you need to handle the term meta population yourself), and a count of the terms in this taxonomy in the 'At a Glance' dashboard widget.

The `register_extended_taxonomy()` function is ultimately a wrapper for `register_taxonomy()`, so any of the latter's parameters can be used.
